PRODUCT TERMS OF USE

**1\. AI Model Usage Policy**

-   The Daiana service is based on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models provided by third parties, also known as LLM (Large Language Models). For everything regarding the management of the former, the CUSTOMER agrees to respect the terms of use of the owner of the LLM models.
-   The CUSTOMER will connect to Artificial Intelligence models through an account provided by SEIDOR Analytics or may also choose to use their own account.
-   In the event that the CUSTOMER decides to use their own account to connect to Artificial Intelligence models, they will be responsible for all activities and costs associated with the management of said account (API Key generation, credit renewal, etc.).
-   Daiana is a tool developed by SEIDOR Analytics to facilitate the adoption of Artificial Intelligence solutions in companies and has no association with the companies owning the Artificial Intelligence models. Improper use of this tool may constitute a violation of the Terms and Conditions of said companies, so liability for sanctions that said companies may undertake is the exclusive responsibility of the CUSTOMER.
-   Due to the nature of machine learning, results may not be unique for all users and Services may generate equal or similar results. For example, you may provide input data to a model like "What color is the sky?" and receive results like "The sky is blue". Other users may also ask similar questions and receive the same or another answer. Answers requested by other users and generated for them are not considered your Content.
-   Artificial Intelligence and machine learning are rapidly evolving fields of study. We are constantly working to improve our Services and make them more accurate, reliable, safe, and beneficial. Given the probabilistic nature of machine learning, use of our Services may in some situations result in incorrect Results that do not accurately reflect real people, places, or facts. You must evaluate the accuracy of any Result as appropriate for your use case, including human review of the Result.
-   Companies owning Artificial Intelligence models may periodically update the version of their LLM models and this may affect the normal service of Daiana, in which case the commitment is to do everything possible to restore the service and keep the application updated to maintain the functions mentioned on this page.
