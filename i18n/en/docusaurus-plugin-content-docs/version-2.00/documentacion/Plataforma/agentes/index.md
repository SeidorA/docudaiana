The **Agent** section is the operational core of Daiana, where all functionalities related to the use and configuration of conversational assistants are concentrated.

From here you can access two main views:

<div className="row">
    <div className="col">
        <Cardcre title="Chats" description="Access the conversation interface with your assistants. This view allows you to interact with agents in real-time, whether for testing, support, operational tasks, or query automation." link="" icon="message" />
    </div>

    <div className="col">
        <Cardcre title="Manage" description="Configure and customize the behavior of each agent. In this section, you can edit their responses, adjust behavior parameters, integrate knowledge sources, modify permissions, and much more." link="" icon="gear" />
    </div>
</div>
