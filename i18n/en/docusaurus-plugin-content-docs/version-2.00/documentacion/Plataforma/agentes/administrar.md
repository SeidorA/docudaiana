Each agent is displayed in an individual card with the following information:

- **Custom image**: If the agent was configured with an image, it is shown here. Otherwise, Daiana's eyes are shown as the default avatar.
- **Agent name**
- **Brief description** of its purpose or function
- **Knowledge Bases**: tags indicating the types of connected sources (e.g., `Docs`, `Data`, `Cloud`).
- **"Edit" button**: allows modifying the agent's configuration.

> This view is designed to provide visual and quick navigation between agents, facilitating both maintenance and exploration.
