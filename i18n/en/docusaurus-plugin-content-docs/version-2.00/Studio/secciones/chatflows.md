### Card View
The Card View presents each flow as a visual card with summarized information. This view is ideal for users who prefer more visual navigation or work with a moderate number of flows.
Each card includes:

- The flow's name.
- A short description (if available).
- Quick access to actions such as edit, duplicate, or delete.

This view facilitates quick identification of flows through visual elements and helps maintain an organized and intuitive experience.

### List View

The List View displays flows in a table format, allowing more flows to be seen simultaneously with more detailed information. It is especially useful for advanced users or those managing a high volume of flows.
Each row in the list includes:

- Flow name.
- Creation and last edited date.
- Available actions.

Additionally, the list allows sorting and filtering columns for more efficient management.
