Each flow in Daiana Studio is composed of nodes that represent specific functions such as **Text Input**, **Processing with LLM models**, **Data Transformation**, **Knowledge Base Query**, among others, and can be logically connected to solve tasks from start to finish. This modular structure facilitates the orchestration of intelligent agents adapted to multiple use cases: from virtual assistants and document analysis to more advanced business integrations.

With an **intuitive interface**, customization capabilities, and compatibility with proprietary or third-party models, Daiana Studio offers a flexible and powerful solution to automate AI flows quickly, securely, and collaboratively.
